# E-Halal BTECHenyo Voting System - Interface Rejuvenation Documentation
### January 21-25, 2025

## Overview
This documentation covers the major improvements made to the E-Halal BTECHenyo Voting System's interface and architecture during the period of January 21-25, 2025. The changes focused on transforming the voting interface from a basic form-based system to an intuitive, card-based interface while simultaneously refactoring the codebase from procedural to object-oriented architecture.

## 1. Architectural Transformation

### 1.1 Previous Architecture
The original system was built using a procedural approach with several limitations:
- Monolithic code blocks handling multiple responsibilities
- Direct database operations mixed with business logic
- UI rendering coupled with data processing
- Hard-to-maintain election configurations
- Limited code reusability
- Complex debugging process
- Poor separation of concerns

### 1.2 New Object-Oriented Architecture
Transformed the system into a modular, object-oriented architecture with clear separation of concerns:

#### Core Classes Overview

##### Database Class
```php
class Database {
    private static $instance = null;
    private $connection;
    
    // Singleton pattern implementation
    public static function getInstance() {
        if (self::$instance === null) {
            self::$instance = new self();
        }
        return self::$instance;
    }
    
    // Secure database operations
    public function escape($value) {
        return $this->connection->real_escape_string($value);
    }
}
```

##### Election Class
```php
class Election {
    private $db;
    private $session;
    
    public function isElectionActive() {
        $election = $this->getCurrentElection();
        if (!$election) return false;

        $now = new DateTime();
        $start = $election['start_time'] ? new DateTime($election['start_time']) : null;
        $end = new DateTime($election['end_time']);

        return $election['status'] === 'on' && 
               $start && $now >= $start && 
               $now <= $end;
    }
}
```

## 2. Core System Components

### 2.1 User Management
```php
class User {
    protected $id;
    protected $firstname;
    protected $lastname;
    
    public function login($voters_id, $password) {
        // Secure authentication logic
    }
    
    public function isLoggedIn() {
        return $this->session->getSession('voter') !== null;
    }
}
```
- Handles user authentication
- Manages user sessions
- Controls access permissions
- Stores user information securely

### 2.2 Ballot Management
- Manages voting interface
- Handles vote submission
- Implements vote validation
- Controls candidate display

### 2.3 View Management
- Handles UI rendering
- Manages templates
- Controls layout structure
- Implements responsive design

## 3. User Interface Improvements

### 3.1 Card-Based Selection System
- Implemented clickable candidate cards replacing traditional radio/checkbox inputs
- Added visual feedback with green border (`#249646`) and light background (`#f8fff9`) for selected cards
- Hidden original form inputs using `display: none !important; visibility: hidden !important`
- Removed iCheck plugin dependency for cleaner implementation

### 3.2 Responsive Grid Layout
```css
.candidates-grid {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(250px, 1fr));
    gap: 20px;
    margin-bottom: 20px;
}

.candidate-card {
    cursor: pointer;
    transition: all 0.3s ease;
    border: 2px solid transparent;
    border-radius: 8px;
    overflow: hidden;
}
```

### 3.3 Interactive States
- Hover effects on candidate cards
- Clear visual feedback for selection
- Disabled state styling (`opacity: 0.6`) for cards when max votes reached
- Smooth transitions for all state changes

### 3.4 Maximum Vote Enforcement
```javascript
document.getElementById('ballotForm').addEventListener('submit', function(e) {
    const sections = this.querySelectorAll('.position-section');
    let valid = true;
    
    sections.forEach(section => {
        const selectedCount = section.querySelectorAll('.candidate-input:checked').length;
        const maxVote = parseInt(section.dataset.maxVote);
        if (selectedCount > maxVote) {
            valid = false;
            alert(`You can only select up to ${maxVote} candidate(s) for ${section.querySelector('.position-title').textContent}`);
        }
    });
    
    if (!valid) {
        e.preventDefault();
    }
});
```

## 4. Security Enhancements
